          Hey there! I'm {{ your_name }}, a tech enthusiast with a love for coding, learning new technologies, and constantly pushing myself to grow. This blog is my fun project where I document my journey in coding, explore new ideas, and share my thoughts on anything that sparks my interest.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Skills & Tools:</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Python:</strong> My go-to programming language for all things coding.</li>
          <li><strong>Flask:</strong> Building web apps with ease.</li>
          <li><strong>Version Control (Git):</strong> Keeping my projects organized and under control.</li>
          <li><strong>SQLite 3:</strong> Managing databases with simplicity.</li>
          <li><strong>SMTP:</strong> Sending emails like a pro.</li>
          <li><strong>Jinja:</strong> Templating to bring dynamic content to life.</li>
          <li><strong>Hosted on Render:</strong> My blog is up and running thanks to Render's smooth deployment platform.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>My Interests:</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Coding:</strong> I love solving problems and writing clean, efficient code.</li>
          <li><strong>Learning DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms):</strong> Continuously building my problem-solving skills and getting better at coding challenges.</li>
          <li><strong>Hackathons:</strong> There's nothing like the thrill of hackathons—building projects in a fast-paced environment and collaborating with talented people.</li>
          <li><strong>Exploring New Tech:</strong> Always curious about emerging technologies and tools that can enhance my skillset.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>
          When I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me reading about the latest tech trends, experimenting with new frameworks, or preparing for the next hackathon challenge. I'm passionate about learning, growing, and sharing my knowledge along the way.

        For this project I would like to give much of credits to Angela Yue and her course on Udemy 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, which enabled me to learn about above tools. In this project my main focus was on to give a backend to the site and much of frontend and templates were taken from Angela's course.
